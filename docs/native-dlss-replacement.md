# Game-DLSS replacement

The Vulkan renderer can replace a recognized game-DLSS evaluation with NVIDIA DLSS on
Windows, then AMD FSR 3.1.4 if NVIDIA DLSS is disabled or unavailable. FSR uses AMD's
eight temporal-upscaling passes, including depth, motion, history and optional RCAS.
This is separate from the presentation filters that scale the finished window image.

The old custom temporal history blend and its jitter-only spatial substitute have been
removed. If neither replacement can run, the shader-cache interception leaves the native
dispatch enabled. An already-rejected native tensor shader remains an explicit dispatch
failure; it is not reported as a successful replacement. General tensor emulation remains.

## Supported input contract

Selection currently recognizes Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave's captured prepass and output
shader, under its exact program ID. It requires matching B10G11R11 input/output, R16G16
motion, D32 depth and a fresh jitter sample. The upstream contract uses reversed depth,
normalized motion toward the previous frame, HDR color and jitter in render pixels.
Resolution scaling scales the render extent and jitter together. History resets on size
changes, first use and evaluation gaps longer than 250 ms. An explicit game camera-cut
reset is not yet extracted.

Fast Fusion's shaders still execute natively. Its captured shader identities are known,
but motion scale/direction, jitter units, depth convention, reset and resource roles have
not been proven for this LLE path. The RGBA16F menu/DLAA path also requires alpha handling
that the Fire Emblem contract does not provide. Turning on NVIDIA DLSS does not override
these safety checks and is not evidence of a Fast Fusion visual fix.

For a diagnostic run, `EDEN_NX2_DLSS_CONTRACT_TRACE=1` logs at most 24 matching Fast Fusion
dispatches per compute engine. `EDEN_NX2_DLSS_CONTRACT_SKIP=N` skips the first N matching
dispatches, capped at one million. Logs include exact shader identity, QMD launch dimensions,
bounded constant-buffer words and raw texture descriptors. They contain guest addresses
and should remain private. No shaders are skipped or game files changed by this capture.

## Settings and comparison runs

"Use NVIDIA DLSS in place of a game's DLSS" defaults to off and takes effect when the game
starts. Disabled means no NVIDIA runtime is loaded; the validated replacement uses FSR 3.1.
Missing DLLs, unsupported GPUs and failed DLSS recording fall back to FSR. Failed evaluation
output is not displayed. Recording waits for the scheduler worker, not GPU completion,
before choosing the fallback. This adds CPU synchronization whose in-game cost is unmeasured.

`EDEN_NX2_DLSS_REPLACEMENT=fsr` forces FSR for comparison. `native` preserves the guest
evaluation. The old `standin` and `EDEN_NX2_DLSS_STANDIN` modes no longer select a fallback.
The RCAS sharpness setting controls FSR's sharpening. NVIDIA model-selection overrides
from the upstream implementation remain available for diagnostic comparisons.

## Build and distribution

FSR needs no external runtime. Keep `externals/FidelityFX-SDK/LICENSE.txt` and its attribution
with distributions. The vendored files are unmodified AMD MIT sources from FidelityFX SDK
v1.1.4, commit `c6efa6bf7f2027b3ec94f28578bb5965eabb9e55`.

For the optional Windows NVIDIA path, obtain only the MIT Streamline headers and license
from NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline tag `v2.14.16`, commit
`625db07d4bca5abc67d781c42af7e7fb0761f1b6`. The SDK directory must contain `include/sl.h`,
`include/sl_dlss.h`, `include/sl_helpers_vk.h`, `include/sl_security.h` and their companion
headers. Configure with `-DEGLANTINE_STREAMLINE_SDK=<header-root>`. This adds Windows
`version`, `wintrust` and `crypt32` libraries, not NVIDIA import libraries. Retain Streamline's
MIT `license.txt` in the packaged notices.

Do not bundle NVIDIA's proprietary DLLs. The Graphics panel obtains missing files from
NVIDIA's Streamline release only after the user reviews and accepts the license texts.
The runtime searches `EDEN_STREAMLINE_DIR`, the user `streamline` directory, then the
executable's `streamline` directory. It verifies the interposer signature and supports the
NVIDIA app's signed DLSS model. The UI and Windows loading path require Windows validation.

## Provenance

This backport is AI-assisted and requires human review and testing before distribution.
It carries upstream work by Duck912 from Eglantine commits `08dbcc7e3b3d`, `11cebf56014a`
and PR #434 through `f9d0c802e8e4`, plus Jonas's warning fix `537c1f4e173a`. The empty-extension requirement
fix `1889602c7a0d` is a separately included follow-up. Existing SPDX notices and AMD/NVIDIA
license text are retained. No commit, push or upstream submission was made by the agent.
